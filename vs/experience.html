<p><b>About DataChat</b></p>
<p>DataChat lets users analyze data and uncover insights in real-time—simply by asking questions in plain English. It integrates seamlessly with popular data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and AWS Redshift.</p>
<br />
<p><b>My Contributions</b></p>
<p>I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer 1 in January 2025 and joined the release team, which is responsible for managing hosted environments (development and production servers), CI/CD pipelines, cloud assets, and the software development processes. So far I have worked on:</p>
<p><b>Load Testing Initiative:</b> Proposed and implemented the adoption of the <a href="https://www.artillery.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artillery</a> load testing tool to effectively evaluate the performance and scalability of DataChat's SaaS platform. The load testing initiative uncovered scalability bottlenecks that were impeding application performance. Highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researched and compared various load testing tools to identify the best fit for the platform's requirements.</li>
  <li>Set up Playwright scripts to simulate user interactions with the application for realistic load scenarios.</li>
  <li>Configured AWS Lambda and ElastiCache via Terraform to manage application users and session state for distributed load tests.</li>
  <li>Established CI triggers to automatically run distributed load tests with multiple workers on AWS Fargate, enabling scalable and automated performance testing.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>CI/CD Initiative:</b> Led efforts to modernize deployment and release processes for DataChat's hosted environments. Achievements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researched and evaluated deployment strategies to identify the most effective approach for minimizing downtime and manual intervention during production upgrades.</li>

  <li>Reduced manual deployment effort and advanced the organization toward a fully cloud-native CI/CD pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>VertexAI Vector Search Integration:</b> Led a team of three developers to overhaul DataChat's vector database library and services, enabling support for multiple vector database providers, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VertexAI Vector Search</a> and <a href="https://milvus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Milvus</a>. My role involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architected and guided the redesign of the vector database abstraction layer to allow seamless integration with different providers.</li>
  <li>Provided hands-on support to team members with debugging challenging issues during the migration and integration process.</li>
  <li>Reviewed and approved complex pull requests, ensuring code quality and maintainability throughout the project.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>Before that, I was a Software Engineer 2 in the ML and GenAI team, contributing to the company's flagship product "Ava," which offers users a simple chat-based interface to ask freeform questions about their data and leverage generative AI for insights. I:</p>
<p><b>Post-Processing Framework Design:</b> Co-led the design and implementation of a robust post-processing framework for the GenAI team, where I:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developed advanced node and graph-based structures to sanitize and process Python code responses generated by LLMs.</li>
  <li>Engineered translation of processed Python workflows to DataChat Guided English Language, the company's custom SQL execution abstraction language.</li>
  <li>Enabled seamless and safe execution of user queries by bridging LLM output with DataChat's backend systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>LLM Evaluation Framework:</b> Helped set up and modernize the LLM Evaluation Framework for the GenAI team. My involvement included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Proposed the refactor to make the framework fully cloud native, guided a developer through the implementation, and reviewed their work to ensure quality and maintainability. This enabled scalable and efficient evaluation workflows.</li>
  <li>Accelerated the team's ability to benchmark, adopt, and iterate on different LLMs, increasing flexibility and agility in product development.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>GenAI Scalability Improvements:</b> Led a project to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the GenAI platform by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) policies for all GenAI microservices after conducting targeted load tests to identify scaling needs.</li>
  <li>Refactored the microservice responsible for LLM interactions to be multithreaded by moving the in-memory embedding model to a standalone service, improving throughput and reliability.</li>
  <li>Reevaluated and optimized CPU and RAM resource allocations for all microservices in the GenAI stack, ensuring efficient use of cloud resources.</li>
  <li>These improvements resulted in a sizable reduction in Kubernetes-related cloud costs for that month and onwards.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Azure Application Gateway for OpenAI Resource Pooling:</b> Architected the use of the Azure Application Gateway to enhance GenAI service availability. This involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configured the gateway to route requests to a backend pool of OpenAI resources distributed across multiple Azure regions.</li>
  <li>Increased available rate limits by leveraging regional resource quotas, reducing the risk of throttling and service interruptions.</li>
  <li>Significantly improved GenAI uptime and reliability for DataChat users by ensuring high availability and load balancing across regions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Custom LLM Deployment Research:</b> Conducted in-depth research to evaluate options for deploying custom large language models (LLMs) in production. My work included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Investigated and compared cloud providers and platforms (AWS, GCP, Modal) for LLM hosting, focusing on cost, scalability, and ease of integration.</li>
  <li>Benchmarked hardware and infrastructure options to assess performance and cost trade-offs for LLM inference workloads.</li>
  <li>Documented a future implementation pathway for custom LLM deployment, providing a roadmap for the team to follow as product needs evolved.</li>
</ul>

									<p><b>Graph Methods for Particle Tracking</b></br></p><p> The High Luminosity - Large Hadron Collider is in need of efficient and fast particle track reconstruction as algorithms in use are
										unable to scale to current requirements. This project explores Graph Neural Networks as a solution to this problem. </p>
									<p>We used the TrackML Codalab dataset with 9000 events and 100,000 hits from 10,000 particles. The TrackML pipeline comprises of multiple stages
										including processing, embedding, filtering, and GNN.
									</p>
									<p>In the Processing stage, feature engineering was performed to select cluster features to construct events from TrackML dataset.</p>
									<p> 
										The Embedding pipeline involving graph construction was developed to find a good distance metric between
										pairs of 3D hit measurements wherein pairs belonging to same particles are nearby and further apart for different particles.
										A significant speedup was achieved in the training stage by adapting the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to make use of Fixed Radius Nearest Neighbors (FRNN) on CUDA. Benchmarking 
										was performed to establish the superiority of the FRNN library over competing solutions such as Facebook's Faiss and PyTorch3D KNN. The optimal PyTorch based embedding model with 99% efficiency and 1% purity was generated through hyperparameter scanning.

									<p><b>Deep Learning for Automated Defect Recognition in Electron Microscopy Images</b></br></p><p> Classifying defects in 
										metallic microstructures is done widely in the metallographic industry to understand and assess the  quality and performance
										 of metal alloys. In nuclear applications 
										this process is critical to understand the effects of radiation and design for safe operation of nuclear reactors.</p><p> 
											Defects are frequently identified through electron microscopy, and the image analysis is done by hand, which is slow, error prone and inconsistent.
											Our project focused on automating the process using computer vision techniques based on convolution neural networks. 
											The Univ. of WI team is exploring four implementations of networks, and this project is focused on one known as RetinaNet. </p>
									<p>This project utlized the Keras implementation of RetinaNet. Hyperparameter optimization was performed to obtain the best model. 
										An evaluation pipeline was developed to determine the recall and precision metrics. The detection model performed reasonably well with an average recall of 68% and average precision of 85% on the test set. 
										Relatively low recall stems from inability to detect small defects.
									</p>
									
									<p>I also co-authored a paper and presented the results at the NextGen Research Symposium in Golden, CO.</p>
